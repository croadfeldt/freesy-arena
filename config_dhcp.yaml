# Ansible Playbook: Configure custom DHCP file and network interfaces (6 VLANs)

# Example Usage: To run this playbook reliably across different shells/sudo usage, use JSON format.
# Use null, -1, or empty strings for teams that don't need DHCP configured in that specific position:
# ansible-playbook -e '{"team_numbers": [123, 456, null, -1, "", 000]}' config_dhcp.yaml
